## Description
This project aims to optimize the test case execution process by identifying and grouping similar test cases, reducing the total number of tests, and speeding up feature releases without sacrificing quality.

- `test_optimization.py`: Main script for loading data, finding similar test cases, and processing execution logs.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists project dependencies.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## How to Run
1. Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code) if you haven't already.
2. Open the project folder in VS Code.
3. Ensure you have Python installed.
4. (Optional) Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```sh
